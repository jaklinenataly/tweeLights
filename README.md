# tweeLights

Each year, in living rooms and home-goods stores across the country the same battle unfolds: White or multi-colored lights? The battles are contentious with husbands and wives, neighbors and colleagues pitted against each other and searching for compromise.

In addition, this issue becomes bigger when major stores like Amazon, want to attract their customers during holidays. The choice of light colors may affect the customer's decision to visit or not to visit the store!

In order to solve this issue, and to have some fun, we decided to implement a system that controls the holiday lights' color by analyzing the social feeds and posts on twitter. Scroll down to learn how this project works!

## Installation

Details will follow in April, once we get the system developed. Keep following the project :D
